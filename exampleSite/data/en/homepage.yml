  content: "<br>\nThe Future In Our Hands – Sierra Leone (FIOH-SL) is an indigenous
    Non-Governmental Organization registered with the Ministry of Finance and Economic
    Development (MOFED) and Sierra Leone Association of Non-Governmental Organizations
    (SLANGO) with Head office in Makeni (Bombali district) and sub-offices in Kabala
    town (Koinadugu District) and Mile 91 (Tonkolili District) and Kambia town (Kambia
    District).  It was established in 1993 as an offshoot of what was formally the
    Yoni Farmers’ Union.  In 1994, as the situation in Sierra Leone deteriorated,
    the membership decided that FIOH had a vital role to play in providing assistance
    to those affected by the escalating conflict.<br><br>  The main focus of the organization
    during the rebel war was to complement the emergency relief work of the Government
    of Sierra Leone, as well as that of international and national NGOs. During and
    immediately after the war, FIOH worked in collaboration with CARE International,
    DFID, and WFP, distributing food and other relief items to internally displaced
    persons in their operational areas. \n<br><br> \nFurther activities included providing
    psychosocial support to affected communities and raising awareness on Human Rights,
    HIV and AIDS prevention and control. "
